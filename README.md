# Semester project : Learning Hamiltonian functions from data

## Abstract:

Repository containing code for my semester project "Learning Hamiltonian functions from data" in the LA lab

## Repository content:

- `simple_pendulum` : this folder contains the code and experiments that were run on the simplependulum
- `furuta_pendulum` : this folder contains the code and experiments that were run on the Furuta pendulum

Both of these folders are organized in the following way :

- `data`: contains folders that contain experiment runs, where the plots model stats and training and test sets are saved
- `notebook` : contains the notebooks that run .py files in the `src` folder
- `src`: contains the .py files used to run the experiments

## Requirements / How to run:

If you will run this on your own computer:

1) Create a virtual environment using either conda or venv, then activate that virtual environment.

2. Open terminal (anaconda terminal or git bash), cd to this repository's directory, and run :`pip install -r requirements.txt `

If you will run this code using google colab download this repository, place it in a folder in your google drive and then follow the instructions in the first cell of the notebooks in each folder.
